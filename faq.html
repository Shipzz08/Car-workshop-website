                  If you notice any of the following signs, it's time to have your brakes checked: squeaking or grinding noises, reduced braking performance, a soft brake pedal, or a pulsating sensation when you apply the brakes. Regular brake inspections can catch issues before they become major problems..

                  If your check engine light illuminates, it's best to schedule a diagnostic check as soon as possible. This light can indicate various issues, from minor to serious. Ignoring it can lead to more extensive and costly repairs down the road. We have the equipment and expertise to diagnose and resolve the issue.
